# Rippled Network Crawler

This crawls the ripple network,
via making requests to the /crawl endpoint of each peer it can connect to,
starting from an entry point. Some peers may know, and publish (perhaps errantly
.. ), the ip associated with a peer, while others don't. We merge the points of
view of each peer, collecting a dict of data, keyed by ip address.

This maps out the connections between all rippled servers (not necessarily UNLS)
who (for the most part) don't even participate in Consensus or at least don't
have any say in influencing the outcome of a transaction on mainnet.

## Installation

```
npm install -g rippled-network-crawler
```


## Usage

To list program options and commands run `--help or -h`

```
$ rippled-network-crawler --help

  Usage: rippled-network-crawler [options] [command]


  Commands:

    enter <ipp>                     Crawl ipp and its peers recursively
    selective <ipp> [otherIpps...]  Crawl specified ipps without expanding crawl to peers
    prior <dbUrl>                   Crawl selectively on ipps from latest crawl in the database
    info <dbUrl> <id>               Get information about a crawl in the database by id
    graphify <dbUrl> <id>           Get a json representing a d3 graph of a crawl by id
    forever <ipp> <dbUrl>           run crawl forever starting from ipp (-s flag will be turned on automatically)

  Options:

    -h, --help           output usage information
    -V, --version        output the version number
    -m, --max <count>    Max number of http requests to have open at once, default 100
    -r, --readable       Output json with four space indentation
    -s, --store <dbUrl>  stores crawl output into the database specified (quietly)
    -q, --quiet          Only output crawl json, all logging is ignored
    -l, --logsql         Log all sequelize queries and ddl
```

## Output structure

`crawl.js` outputs a stringified json in the following format:

|   Field    |    Description           | Type   |
|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| start      | Crawl start time         | date   |
| end        | Crawl end time           | date   |
| entry      | Crawl entry ip:port      | string |
| data       | Raw data collected       | array  |
| errors     | Errors                   | array  |

## Schema

### crawl

|   Column   |           Type           |
|------------|--------------------------|
| id         | bigint                   |
| start_at   | timestamp with time zone |
| end_at     | timestamp with time zone |
| entry_ipp  | string                   |
| data       | text                     |
| exceptions | text                     |
| created_at | timestamp with time zone |
| updated_at | timestamp with time zone |

## Visualize

The `graphify` command can be used to produce a json which can be
visualized with `misc/index.html`. Note that `index.html` looks for a file
called `graph.json` in its same directory.

Node color is indicative version.

Node size is indicative of out going and incoming connection count.

``` bash
npm install http-server -g
rippled-network-crawler graphify $DATABASE_URL 1 > misc/graph.json
cd misc/
http-server -o
```

## /crawl response format <a id="response"></a>

As of the time of writing, there were various versions of rippled on the network
and not all of them return information formatted in the same way, so some
normalisation must be done. Also, some fields aren't always published (like in
the case of `ip`). The public_key is returned in base64, so to match public keys
encoded in base58 and saved as a string elsewhere, they must be normalised.

The top level structure of the response is as so:

```json
    {
      "overlay" : {
        "active"  : [
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
```

And there are various forms for each element (connected peer) in `active`:

* With `"ip"` and `"type" : "in"`
```json
    {
      "ip": "24.234.130.12",
      "public_key": "A2JwZ1y3iHno7/faxWfuhLF1skYPhMeLgURxyUzLT93B",
      "type": "in",
      "version": "rippled-0.28.0-b21"
    },
```

* With `"ip"` and `"type" : "out"` and `"port"`
```json
    {
      "ip": "54.186.73.52",
      "port": "51235",
      "public_key": "AjikFnq0P2XybCyREr2KPiqXqJteqwPwVRVbVK+93+3o",
      "type": "out",
      "version": "rippled-0.28.0-rc3"
    },
```

* With `"ip"` and `"type": "peer``
  * Without a port packed in `ip`, the `type` is actually `"in"`
```json
    {
      "ip": "54.164.144.101",
      "public_key": "A8vPtayIaLdyV/2gLkWigyr1vwK2qqrre8ABRh2sXmMT",
      "type": "peer",
      "version": "rippled-0.28.0"
    },
```

* With `"ip"` (with a port)  and `"type": "peer``
  * With a port packed in `ip`, the `type` is  `"out"`
```json
    {
      "ip": "23.239.3.247:51235",
      "public_key": "An366bc/eRsF01nmfnz6j2JnBA7gpSr7BCVygePEoWgs",
      "type": "peer",
      "version": "rippled-0.28.1-b5"
    },
```

* With only `"public_key"" to identify node.

  * Unfortunately we don't know the direction of the connection in these cases
    but sometimes we have the direction information from another peers
    perspective. We may also have the ip from another peers POV.
```json
    {
      "public_key": "An2mhwWHnwzBehh88G+vpwwwqviFAqMl9rjU2PnDELr9",
      "type": "peer",
      "version": "rippled-0.28.0-rc3"
    },
```
